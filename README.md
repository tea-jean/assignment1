# T1A2 - Terminal Application Assessment
##Statement of Purpose and Scope
The Dream Dog terminal application was developed in order to aid future dog owners with selection of a suitable breed by matching desired canine attributes with pedigree dog breeds. 
With so many breeds, and crosses of those breeds, choosing a suitable dog breed for an owners lifestyle can be a complex, albeit fun, research mission.
The development of an application to match characteristics desired by an owner, to a breed which embodies such qualities can help to refine the decision making process when looking for a puppy, or even an older dog. The selection of an appropriate breed for an owners lifestyle may be important in keeping dogs in their homes long term, and avoid pressures on rescue organisations and pound facilities who take on board thousands of dogs annually who are not a good fit for their homes. 
Target audience for the Dream Dog application are individuals, couples or families who are are in the midst of, or about to embark on, a journey to research and find the right dog breed to fit their particular needs and lifestyle. 
Members of the target audience will get the most out of the features of the Dream Dog application by first accepting to participate in the application with a simple 'yes' or 'no' response in the terminal. The application puts forth suggestions pertaining to preferences ear type, activity levels and coat type. Users select the attribute most suitable to them, and are then prompted with the next attribute selection. 
The selections made by the user are printed on the screen after the selection process is complete.
Where the attributes selected by the user match to a breed within Dream Dog, the breed match is displayed. In this case the result is written to a text file for the user to refer back to.
In the case where no unique match can be sought, an alternate suggestion or breed/s is printed on screen. These suggested breeds match with two of the users selected attributes only.
Once a breed match, or a suggested alternative are printed on screen, the application terminates.
